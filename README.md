# Weather-App

Using BeautifulSoup4, this scrapes weather information, that is displayed on a Google search, for the specified location. The weather information currently includes the current temperature of the specified location, as well as the maximum day temperatures and the minimum night temperatures for today and for the next seven days for that location.

This information is then displayed in a GUI using PySimpleGUI.
